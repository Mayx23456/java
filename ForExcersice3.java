// Write a Java program that declares a String with a variable name of your choosing. 
// Assign your own name as the value of the String. 

// Then output to screen the following information and perform the following operations on the string (using the methods that are provided using the dot operator):

// Print out the string
// Print out the number of characters in the string
// Print out the first and second characters in the string
// Print out the string with the lowercase characters replaced by uppercase characters
// Print out the string with all occurrences of the letter ‘a’ replaced by ‘%’
// Print out the position within the string of the first and last occurrences of the character ‘r.
// (note strings are indexed from zero i.e. zero is the first position.

// For example if the input string is: Darryl Stewart

// Then the output should be:
// The input String : Darryl Stewart
// The number of characters in the string : 14
// The first character in the string is D and the second character in the string is a
// The string in uppercase : DARRYL STEWART
// The string with the letter a replaced with % is : D%rryl Stew%rt
// The character ‘r’ first occurs in position 3
// The character ‘r’ last occurs in position 13
